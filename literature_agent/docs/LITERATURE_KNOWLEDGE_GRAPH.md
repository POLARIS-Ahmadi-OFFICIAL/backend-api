# LiteratureAgent Knowledge Graph

## Recommended Architecture

Use an **evidence-grounded claim-centered scientific property graph** as the
canonical knowledge graph.

- A DAG is useful for selected directed reasoning paths, but scientific
  literature relationships are not naturally acyclic.
- A Sankey diagram is useful for showing aggregated flows, but it is a
  visualization rather than a knowledge representation.
- A property graph supports papers, devices, materials, layers, processes,
  measurements, stability tests, scientific claims, structured observations,
  mechanisms, outcomes, and evidence as reusable nodes connected by typed
  relationships with provenance properties.

The graph separates three epistemic levels:

1. **Database facts:** strict structured fields such as device stacks, PCE, and
   stability values.
2. **Extracted observations:** material-specific optical, electrical,
   processing, and stability observations from consolidated extraction JSON.
3. **Reported scientific claims:** exact statements from paper summaries,
   explicitly represented as claims rather than universal facts.

Directional relationships such as `IMPROVES`, `REDUCES`, and `PROMOTES` retain
the source claim, paper, extraction field, and evidence links.

The implementation produces portable GraphML/JSONL and Neo4j-compatible bulk
import CSVs. Neo4j is an optional serving/database layer, not a requirement for
building or validating the graph.

## Build Command

```powershell
cd "E:\LiteratureAgentProject"

python .\scripts\build_literature_knowledge_graph.py `
  --records "E:\LiteratureAgent\lit_outputs\csv\all_records.csv" `
  --ontology ".\config\perovskite_ontology_library_v19.json" `
  --work-dir "E:\LiteratureAgent\lit_outputs" `
  --out "E:\LiteratureAgent\artifacts_literature_knowledge_graph"
```

The same build can be run through the main LiteratureAgent controller:

```powershell
python "E:\LiteratureAgentProject\literature_agent_full_end_to_end_v21_3_english_sanitizer.py" `
  --pipeline_stage knowledge_graph `
  --base_csv "C:\Users\jorda\Downloads\Perovskite_database_content_all_data.csv" `
  --ontology_path "E:\LiteratureAgentProject\config\perovskite_ontology_library_v19.json" `
  --work_dir "E:\LiteratureAgent\lit_outputs" `
  --knowledge_graph_out_dir "E:\LiteratureAgent\artifacts_literature_knowledge_graph"
```

One-record test:

```powershell
python .\scripts\build_literature_knowledge_graph.py `
  --records "E:\LiteratureAgent\lit_outputs\csv\all_records.csv" `
  --ontology ".\config\perovskite_ontology_library_v19.json" `
  --work-dir "E:\LiteratureAgent\lit_outputs" `
  --out ".\knowledge_graph_test" `
  --max-records 1
```

## POLARIS Integration

For POLARIS, treat the graph builder as a separate resumable stage after
`extract_batch` or `vision_pass`. The portable JSONL is convenient for agent
tools, while the Neo4j CSVs are appropriate when a persistent graph database is
available.

Recommended agent queries include:

- Which spacer cations are associated with high PCE in 2D devices?
- Which device stacks appear in papers reporting stability evidence?
- Which characterization methods support a claimed mechanism?
- Which papers connect a material/additive to both performance and stability?
- Which extracted relationships still lack visual or textual evidence?
- What mechanisms are reported for spacer-cation or additive improvements?
- Which interventions repeatedly promote stability, charge transport, or
  reduced defect density across multiple papers?
- Which structured observations support or contradict a reported claim?
- Which claims are summary-only and should be prioritized for human review?

## Current Limitation

The graph intentionally reflects current extraction coverage. A relationship
derived from a summary is stored as a reported claim, not promoted to consensus
or treated as a validated universal fact. Cross-paper relationship counts are
provided for discovery, but human review or stronger evidence aggregation is
required before treating repeated claims as scientific consensus.
